Some basic troubleshooting I have had to do

>>> GNOME desktop won't load

1. remote login should still work.
2. Login as root
3. Edit '/etc/inittab'
4. Change 'id:5:initdefault:' to 'id:5:initdefault:'. 3 is non-GUI mode.
5. Reboot
6. As normal user, ~$ startx
7. Need further delevopments to start automatically and solve problem.
